# Programming in Assembly 8086

This repository is created to document the learning process about the use of the Assembly programming language, specifically for the 8086 microprocessor.

## About Assembly Language

Assembly is a low-level programming language used to write programs that are very close to machine language. Unlike high-level languages, Assembly allows precise control over the computer hardware, making it ideal for tasks that require extreme performance optimization. In this repository, we will learn about Assembly syntax, how to write and debug programs in this language, and its application in systems programming.

## About Intel 8086 Microprocessor
